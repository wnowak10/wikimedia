I completed this data science task for the Wikimedia Data Scientist job opening for fun. I was not a candidate for the position, but came across this [link](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/02/02/hiring-data-scientist/) and decided it'd be a fun exercise to work through. I hadn't done as much SQL-like data manipulation in pandas before, this task was great for that skill!
